### Registering a New Account
To register an account, click the **Account** dropdown on the navigation bar at the top of the page, then click **Register**. This option will appear only if you are not already logged in. When choosing a username, make sure it meets the following requirements:
* It must be 1-20 characters long.
* It may contain only the letters 'A' through 'Z' (upper or lowercase), the digits '0' through '9', hyphens '-', and underscores '_'.

Be sure to pick a strong password that is both not easily guessable and is not the same as your accounts on other websites. Entering an email address is optional, however it will allow you to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

### Account Profile
Each CyTube account can set a profile photo and short description. On the navigation bar at the top of the page click **Account**, then **Profile**. You can then enter the URL of a profile image (the URL must end in .gif, .jpg, or .png,) and enter a short text blurb that will be displayed when users hover over your name in the chat username list.  
**Important**: this is publicly visible to anyone, so don't use a private photo or include private information in your description.

### Changing your Password or Email Address
On the navigation bar at the top of the page click **Account**, then **Change Password / Email**. You must provide your current password in order to change either of these settings. You can leave the email address box blank if you wish to remove the email address from your account. (Be aware that this means you will no longer be able to receive password reset emails.)

### Recovering an Account If You Lost the Password
From the login page, click **Forgot password?** You will be prompted to enter your username and email address. The email address must match the one associated with your account. If you have not linked an email address to your account, you cannot reset your password automatically and will need to contact an administrator for help. Otherwise, you will receive an email with a link to reset your password.
