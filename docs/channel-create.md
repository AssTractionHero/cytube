You must be logged in to your account to manage your channels.

### Registering a Channel
In the navigation bar at the top of the page click on **Account** then click on **Channels**.  In the right column, enter the 
desired channel name and click **Register**.  If that channel is not already registered to another account, it will be created
and registered to your name.  The website administrator may limit the number of channels that can be registered to one account.

### Deleting a Channel
In the navigation bar at the top of the page click on **Account** then click on **Channels**.  The left column lists all channels
registered to your name.  Click the **Delete** button to unregister a channel.  This will permanently clear all database information
(ranks, library, bans,) and state information (playlist, configuration, MOTD, filters, etc.,) and is **non-reversible**.
You will be asked to confirm your deletion.
