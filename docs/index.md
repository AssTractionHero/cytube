## I need more help with answering my question!
1. Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/AssTractionHero/cytube/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) and check whether that answers your question.
2. There is a more extensive explanation of the functions of CyTube in the [CyTube 3.0 User Guide](https://github.com/AssTractionHero/cytube/wiki/CyTube-3.0-User-Guide).
3. If your question is not answered from these sources,  you can try the CyTube IRC at `irc.6irc.net #cytube` ([webchat](https://webchat.6irc.net/?channels=cytube) available), the official support channel for https://cytu.be and https://synchtu.be, and general questions about using the software.  Please be patient, it may take time for someone to respond. Most of the users in the support channel are in the United States, so you have a better chance of contacting someone during daytime hours in the US.

If nobody is available on IRC, or you want to speak privately, email one of the contacts on https://cytu.be/contact.
